Neural networks can perform really powerful tasks. We're going to use them to do something relatively simple, but this framework can be expanded to solve more complex problems.

In this exercise, we're going to use a dataset of handwritten letters called EMNIST. This dataset is a subset of a larger dataset composed of handwritten letters and numbers that was orginally collected from census bureau employees and high school students.

Because different people write letters differently, programming a neural network to recognize handwritten letters and convert them to typed text is a non-trivial task. For example, think about all of the different ways you've seen people write the letter "J."
